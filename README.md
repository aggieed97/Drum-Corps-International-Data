# Drum Corps International Data for World Class Corps for all scored events from 2013 to 2018

CSV file has 5 fields:
1. Date - datetime - Date of Competition
2. Location - Object - Location of Competition
3. Rank - Object - Rank at end of the Competition
4. Score - Float - Final Score of the Competition
5. Corps - String

All data was scraped from the DCI.org/scores page.  Data only goes back to 2013 there (not sure why, maybe somebody can enlighten me).

Feel free to do whatever analysis you would like with this data.
